          WHAT IS<br></br>PALOMA?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Paloma is a fast, permissionless, Cosmos-SDK blockchain that moves smart-contract
          messages fast and securely, between any other public blockchain with an active RPC
          endpoint. Paloma is designed for developers who wish to manage multi-directional messages
          between multiple chains in a scalable and secure manner. Blockchain smart contracts cannot
          self-execute state change on the blockchains on which they are deployed. As such, they
          require that state changes, and the accompanying computation of new logic, be sent to the
          smart contract from another state.

        <span className="p-white-50 mt-20">
          Today these state changes are commonly run by centralized, custom-designed, closed-source
          programs, human-multisignature key arrangements, or low-end, multi-party computation
          circuits. The complexity and richness of these approaches is limited by the lack of
          engineering resources and developer-friendly environments that encourage sophisticated
          state and logic-call development.

        <h2>Paloma chain</h2>
        <span className="mt-20">
        To solve this problem, Paloma aims to bring multichain, 
        gas-optimized, MEV-protected, and scheduled, messages 
        managed by a permissionless validator set that manages 
        both chain security and message security.
        
         In the Paloma protocol, validators fulfill two crucial roles. 
         They secure the network through the Proof of Stake 
         mechanism and also act as Pigeons(Relayers) who relay 
         multi-directional, scheduled messages between Paloma 
         and any other supported blockchain. 
        
        In Paloma, validators are not able to opt-out of message-
        relay work, without exiting the active-set. 
        To be a validator on Paloma is to secure fast relay
        execution on all chains approved by governance.

        <h2 className="h-white">the validator set</h2>
        <span className="p-white-50 mt-20">
          Since every active validator is also an active Pigeon, all messages are secured through
          consensus and the validators' stake. Validators must run nodes on every Paloma target
          chain and have the infrastructure and available funds to send messages on every chain.
          <br />
          <br />
          If these requirements are not met, validators will be jailed and their stake unbonded.
          Builders on Paloma can rest assured that their messages are secure and will always arrive
          on schedule to the target chains.

        <span className="mt-20">
          Paloma aims to make blockchain messaging ubiquitous and extremely easy for developers.
          Paloma messages are bi-directional and may be repeated or scheduled. Developers can write
          smart contracts in any language accepted by their target blockchain.
          <br />
          <br />
          Developers can control state change logic execution with Paloma's Cosmwasm language.
          Paloma's gas price oracle is unique. Paloma aims to be a decentralized and global gas
          price oracle. Pigeons observe gas prices and provide quotes for message delivery. These
          quotes include a query or message relay fee for the Pigeon Relayers who will execute the
          message.
          <br />
          <br />
          Pigeons will price in the gas price risks, so developers will have dependable message
          delivery costs analysis for any target chain and any message size.
